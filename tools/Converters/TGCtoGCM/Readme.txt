TGCtoGCM by Plootid 2004

Just a little program I wrote for fun.
It's console only, so it might be difficult for some people to use.

TGCtoGCM <infile.tgc> <outfile.gcm>

Simple really.

I've included the source, feel free to use it for whatever (hopefully it's platform independent).

If you find any bugs, you can let me know at:

but don't expect any immediate action. I'm lazy.
