ArcExtract & ArcPack by Lunaboy.

Fixed versions (31.05.2012).
------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage instructions for use with Windows Explorer:
1. Place both executables into an empty directory
2. Copy the .szp (or .arc/.rarc) file from the game to the same directory as the executables
3. Drag the .szp (or .arc/.rarc) file and place it on top of the 'ArcExtract.exe' filename
   (a console window opens and closes)
4. A new directory has been created containing the extracted files and directory structure
- - - - - - - - - - - -
5. Modify the files (do not change the filenames or the directory structure, otherwise the game can't find them)
- - - - - - - - - - - -
6. Go to the directory containing the two executables
7. Drag the previously extracted directory and place it on top of the 'ArcPack.exe' filename
   (a console window opens and closes)
8. A new .arc file has been created (directory name with the '.arc' extension added)
9. Replace the arc extension to needed extension (.szp or .rarc)

------------------------------------------------------------------
The fixes:
- ArcExtract now creates a new directory with the ARC Root name and extracts everything into this directory
- ArcPack now writes the real filesize instead of a rounded-up-to-32-bytes filesize
